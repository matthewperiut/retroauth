 * Widens the handshake string-length cap. Vanilla b1.7.3 reads the handshake
 * string with a small max ({@code readString(stream, 32)}); modern
 * auth/companion mods can carry a longer payload through the handshake, which
 * otherwise trips {@code "Received string length longer than maximum allowed"}.
 *
 * <p>Bumping the constant (rather than {@code @ModifyArg} on the inherited
 * {@code readString} call, whose owner is ambiguous between HandshakePacket and
 * its Packet superclass) is mapping-stable and always applies.
